Hi! I am Shuao Guo(you can call me sheo/ʃiːoʊ/). I am currently on my gap year for my English proficiency exam(IELTS). In January, I received my Master's degree in Technical Competitive Intelligence from [Institue of Scientific and Technical Information of China](https://www.istic.ac.cn/html/1/529/558/index.html). My research is mainly involved in machine translation(especially for low-resource MT , Multilingual MT and short texts MT) and nlp technology for scientific data (structured data extraction, summary generation, keywords extraction and so on ). I am lucky to be supervised by Researcher Yanqing He and Researcher Cheng Dong. And I am also a student member of [Chinese Information Processing Society of China](http://www.cipsc.org.cn/). Now I am looking for a phd postion to go on my research.
