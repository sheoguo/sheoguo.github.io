Hi! I am **Shuao Guo**(you can call me sheo/ʃiːoʊ/). I am currently on my gap year for my English proficiency exam(IELTS). In January, I received my Master's degree in Technical Competitive Intelligence from [Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China](https://www.istic.ac.cn/html/1/529/558/index.html). My previous research is mainly involved in machine translation(especially for low-resource MT , Multilingual MT and short texts MT) and NLP technology for scientific data (structured data extraction, summary generation, keywords extraction and so on ). I am lucky to be supervised by Researcher Yanqing He and Researcher Cheng Dong. And I am also a student member of [Chinese Information Processing Society of China](http://www.cipsc.org.cn/). **I am now seeking a PhD position to continue my research.**.

You can find my **CV** here:[Shuao Guo's Curriculum Vitae](http://sheoguo.github.io/files/Shuao_Guo_CV.pdf).
