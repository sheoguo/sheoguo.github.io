excerpt: "This paper outlines the technical details of ISTIC’s neural machine translation systems for the 19th China Conference on Machine Translation (CCMT 2023). ISTIC participated in two tasks: the Low Resource MT task (Vietnamese-Chinese, Czech-Chinese, Lao-Chinese, Mongolian-Chinese) and the Chinese-Centric Multilingual MT task (Vietnamese-Chinese, Thai-Chinese, Kazakh-Chinese, Hindi-Chinese, Uyghur-Chinese). Context-aware and multilingual systems were developed for these tasks. The paper focuses on the Transformer-based architecture, data preprocessing techniques, and strategies used, and evaluates the systems' performance across different methods."
